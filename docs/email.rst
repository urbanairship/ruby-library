Register Email Channel
----------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'urbanairship'
    UA = Urbanairship
    airship = UA::Client.new(key:'application_key', secret:'master_secret')
    email_channel = UA::Email.new(client: airship)
    email_channel.type = 'email'
    email_channel.commercial_opted_in = '2018-10-28T10:34:22'
    email_channel.address = 'new.name@new.domain.com'
    email_channel.timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
    email_channel.locale_country = 'US'
    email_channel.locale_language = 'en'
    email_channel.register

.. note::

  The registration of an email channel should yield a 201 response. The address
  portion must be defined with an email address to register an email channel.
  There are a few more fields listed on the email object that can be set as well
  such as transactional_opted_in.

Uninstall Email Channel
-----------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'urbanairship'
    UA = Urbanairship
    airship = UA::Client.new(key:'application_key', secret:'master_secret')
    email_channel = UA::Email.new(client: airship)
    email_channel.address = 'new.name@new.domain.com'
    email_channel.uninstall

.. note::

  This will uninstall an existing email channel. Note that a valid email must
  be present to make the request.

Lookup Email Channel
--------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'urbanairship'
    UA = Urbanairship
    airship = UA::Client.new(key:'application_key', secret:'master_secret')
    email_channel = UA::Email.new(client: airship)
    email_channel.address = 'new.name@new.domain.com'
    email_channel.lookup

Update Email Channel
--------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'urbanairship'
    UA = Urbanairship
    airship = UA::Client.new(key:'application_key', secret:'master_secret')
    email_channel = UA::Email.new(client: airship)
    email_channel.channel_id = '01234567-890a-bcde-f012-3456789abc0'
    email_channel.type = 'email'
    email_channel.commercial_opted_in = '2018-10-28T10:34:22'
    email_channel.timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
    email_channel.locale_country = 'US'
    email_channel.locale_language = 'en'
    email_channel.update

.. note::

  The only thing required to make a request is the channel_id. However, anything
  that needs to be updated must also be included. Please note that you cannot
  update an email address with this method. Please use the replace method instead.

Replace Email Channel
---------------------

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'urbanairship'
    UA = Urbanairship
    airship = UA::Client.new(key:'application_key', secret:'master_secret')
    email_channel = UA::Email.new(client: airship)
    email_channel.channel_id = '01234567-890a-bcde-f012-3456789abc0'
    email_channel.address = 'new.name@new.domain.com'
    email_channel.type = 'email'
    email_channel.commercial_opted_in = '2018-10-28T10:34:22'
    email_channel.timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles'
    email_channel.locale_country = 'US'
    email_channel.locale_language = 'en'
    email_channel.update

.. note::

  This will replace an existing email channel and will do the following actions:

  - Register a new channel
  - Associate the new email channel with the same user as the source channel
  - Uninstall the source channel

   Address, Channel ID and type are all required parameters for this method.

Email Tags
----------

Using the Email Tag class inheriting from Channel Tags, tags can be added,
removed, or set for a single email channel.

.. code-block:: ruby

    require 'urbanairship'
    UA = Urbanairship
    airship = UA::Client.new(key:'application_key', secret:'master_secret')
    email_tags = UA::EmailTags.new(client: airship)
    #set an audience
    email_tags.set_audience(email_address: 'new.name@new.domain.com')
    #add a tag
    email_tags.add(group_name: :group_name, tags: :tag1)
    #remove a tag
    email_tags.remove(group_name: :group_name, tags: :tag1)
    #set a tag
    email_tags.set(group_name: :group_name, tags: :tag1)
    #finally, send the request
    email_tags.send_request

.. note::

  The code-block above can be used to set, add, or remove tags depending on the
  needs of the request. An audience or email channel must be set before adding,
  setting, or removing a tag. It should be noted that add and set functionality cannot
  be used simultaneously, as well as remove and set. Conversely, add and remove
  may be used in the same request.
