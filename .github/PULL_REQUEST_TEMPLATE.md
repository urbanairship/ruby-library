**If you want your PR addressed quickly, please also reach out to our [support team](https://support.airship.com/)
so we can understand when you need it reviewed and how it is impacting your use of our services.** We also generally
will not release new versions of our library without new feature support, a bug fix, or a clear reason from a customer
why an update is required to minimize how often other customers need to update.
